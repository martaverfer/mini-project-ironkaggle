### Contiuous values
- Column `"price"` has 4028 unique values.
  - The sale price of the house (prediction target).

  - Dependent variable, the target.
  - Our primary focus is to understand which features most significantly impact the house price. Additionally, we aim to explore properties valued at $650K and above for more detailed insights.

#### Size related features of the houses
- Column `"sqft_lot"` has 9782 unique values.
  - Square footage of the land space.

- Column `"sqft_lot15"` has 8689 unique values.
  - The land spaces for the nearest 15 neighbors in 2015.

- Column `"sqft_living"` has 1038 unique values.
  - Square footage of the interior living space.

- Column `"sqft_above"` has 946 unique values.
  - Square footage of the house apart from the basement.
  
- Column `"sqft_living15"` has 777 unique values.
  - The interior living space for the nearest 15 neighbors in 2015.
  
- Column `"sqft_basement"` has 306 unique values.
  - Square footage of the basement.
  
For all columns starting with prefix `"sqft_"`:
  - All values are integers, but from scatter plot distribution looks like the values can be treated as continuous.
  - Values are highly askewed.

#### Geo location related features of the houses
- Column `"lat"` has 5034 unique values.
  - lat: Latitude coordinate.
  - Continuous.

- Column `"long"` has 752 unique values.
  - long: Longitude coordinate.
